ncurses (new curses) is a free software emulation of curses in 
System V Rel 4.0 (and above). It uses terminfo format, supports 
pads, colors, multiple highlights, form characters and function 
key mapping. Because of the interactive nature of this library, 
it will be of little use for writing Web applications, but may 
be useful when writing scripts meant using PHP from the command 
line.

Redis high-availability cluster using Sentinel to transparently proxy connections to the active primary member.

Redundis is a smart sentinel aware proxy for redis that allows redis clients to not care about failover of the redis master node.

Connections are automatically forwarded to the master redis node, and when the master node fails over, clients are disconnected and reconnected to the new master node.

Redundis was written in luvit because of its near c speed, and because it uses a very small amount of memory.
